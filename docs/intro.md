# Intro

What we call "MiscNinja" is in fact a combination of two independent applications:

- [Paper](https://github.com/MiscNinjaOrg/paper): Written mostly in TypeScript with Next.JS, this is the front-facing UI, which can work with a number of "backends" plugged into it.
- [Sand](https://github.com/MiscNinjaOrg/sand): As of now, written entirely in Python - this is supposed to be a centralized efficient model-serving backend that can be used with Paper.
